# **Wings of Wisdom - Bird Species Classification**

Welcome to the **Wings of Wisdom** project repository! ü¶Ö This project focuses on building a **multi-class classifier** to accurately identify various **bird species** based on images. Leveraging **deep learning**, we use **pretrained models** such as ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, and XceptionNet to classify bird species from a dataset containing images of 200 unique species.

## üåü **Project Overview**

Bird species identification plays a crucial role in biodiversity studies and wildlife preservation. The **Wings of Wisdom** classifier takes on this challenge by classifying bird species with **high accuracy** using cutting-edge **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**. 

Through this project, we aim to develop a scalable and efficient model that can handle real-world image data, where bird species identification is critical.

<br>

## üê¶ **Dataset**

The dataset contains images of **200 bird species**, each labeled with bounding box coordinates, allowing us to isolate and focus on the bird in each image. The dataset is organized as follows:

- **Classes**: 200 bird species
- **Bounding Boxes**: Provided for each image
- **Train/Validation Split**: Data has been split for training and validation to optimize model performance.

<br>

## üß† **Approach**

Our approach to solving the classification task involved several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Image Resizing**: All images were resized to a consistent dimension for input into the models.
   - **Bounding Box Utilization**: Cropped bird images using bounding boxes to focus the model on the bird rather than the background noise.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Applied techniques like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flips to improve generalization.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Fine-tuned several **pretrained models** (ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, XceptionNet) to adapt them to the bird species classification task.
   - Used **transfer learning** to leverage the feature extraction power of pretrained models.

3. **Ensemble Method**:
   - Combined the predictions of multiple models to create a more robust classification system.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **F1 Score** were the primary metrics used to evaluate model performance.

<br>

## üèóÔ∏è **Model Architectures**

We experimented with the following pretrained models:

1. **ResNet50**: Known for its residual connections, ResNet50 helps solve the vanishing gradient problem, making it highly effective for deep learning tasks.

2. **EfficientNetB1**: This model uses a compound scaling method that uniformly scales network depth, width, and resolution, providing efficient and powerful performance on image classification tasks.

3. **XceptionNet**: Based on depthwise separable convolutions, XceptionNet excels in capturing fine-grained details, making it ideal for distinguishing between closely related bird species.

Each model was fine-tuned using the dataset, and their performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

## üìä **Results**

The best model (EfficientNetB1) achieved the following performance:

- **Accuracy**: 95.99%
  
The ensemble approach slightly boosted these numbers, improving the model‚Äôs ability to generalize to new bird species images.

<br>

## ü§Ø **Challenges and Learning**

The most exciting and challenging part of this project was **fine-tuning** the models to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting. The nature of the dataset, with birds that look similar, made it difficult to distinguish between species. However, working with **bounding boxes** and experimenting with **data augmentation** helped improve the model's accuracy significantly.

<br>

## üî≠ **Future Work**

In the future, the project can be improved by:
- **Implementing Object Detection**: Use models like YOLO to simultaneously classify and localize bird species.
- **Incorporating Additional Data**: Using external datasets to further enhance the model's ability to classify rare or endangered species.
- **Deploying as a Web App**: Implement the classifier as a web service where users can upload images and get instant predictions.
